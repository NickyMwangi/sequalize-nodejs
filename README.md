# intro-nodejs

I developed this project to understand the use of sequalize ORM in a nodeJS application using postgress. I have been developing it using mongoDB and I wanted to under it using postgress DB. So some of the lessons learnt during development of thie application were;

#### Deep nderstanding of expressJS

This included inatllation and setting it up which was actually very quick and straightforward. lastly was running it in different ports and adding **CORS\_** for additional security.

#### Sequalize ORM

During development of this project I tested using sequalize with MySQL, mariaDB and settlled on suing it on postgressDB. This project show how to configure it, setting up seeders, migrations and models
Also, I came up with a working project structure that can support wide range of projects.

#### Other features

Some of the user feature in the projet are;

- Using JWTToken for authorization.
- Using bcrypt to encrypt and decrypt user password
- using dotenv
- Using nodemon to track nodeJS application changes.
